# Getting Started with Create React App

I tried creating  a front end real estate appication, where the user can find thier home by filtering the follwing things such as  city, number of beds and rooms as well as the price. With this applcaiton ,users would be able to find a home, view details about that specific home and as well as book a time to vist the home. Unfortunalty, I was not able to complete the front end, due to issues with the back end as my requests werent loading.
